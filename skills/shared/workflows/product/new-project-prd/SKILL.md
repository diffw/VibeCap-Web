name: new-project-prd
description: Guide users through a structured interview to create PRD documents for new projects or features. Captures all product decisions needed for downstream documents (Architecture, IA, Product Spec). Use when user mentions "#新功能", "#新项目", "#创建PRD", "#PRD".
---

# New Project PRD

## When to Use

- Starting a new project or designing a new feature
- Need to create PRD document before development
- Want AI assistance in product definition and competitive research
- Creating PRD for Vibe Coding workflow

## Session Rules

When user replies "continue" (or "继续"), resume from last position:

1. Read `.vibe-doc/PRD.md` to check current state
2. Identify completed sections vs. pending sections marked "[To be filled]"
3. Resume with format:
   ```
   Resuming PRD interview for [ProjectName].
   
   ✅ Completed: [list completed sections]
   ⏳ Current: [current question or phase]
   
   [Continue with next question]
   ```

## .vibe-doc Preservation Gate

- Read `.agents/rules/shared/vibe-doc-preservation.md` before creating or updating any `.vibe-doc/*` file.
- Never overwrite a non-empty `.vibe-doc` document with a blank file or raw template.
- If `.vibe-doc/PRD.md` already exists and is non-empty, read it first and update in place.
- If the user wants a separate feature PRD while an existing canonical PRD already exists, keep the old file and create a disambiguated new file only after user confirmation.
- Never delete sibling PRD / spec files just because the current task focuses on a new feature.

---

## Execution Flow

### Phase 0: Initialization

1. Create directory `.vibe-doc` if not exists
2. Initialize `.vibe-doc/PRD.md` from template **only if the file is missing or empty**
3. If `.vibe-doc/PRD.md` already exists and is non-empty:
   - treat it as the current source of truth
   - resume/update it in place instead of copying a template over it
   - ask before creating a separate feature-specific PRD file

**Prompt:**
```
Starting new project PRD interview.

This interview will capture all product decisions needed for development.
I'll ask questions in phases - answer as briefly or detailed as you like.
