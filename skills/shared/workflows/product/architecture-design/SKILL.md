name: architecture-design
description: Generate Architecture Design document from PRD and IA/User Flow. AI acts as Solutions Architect, recommending technical solutions based on product requirements. User only answers business questions. Use when user mentions "#architecture", "#架构设计", or "continue architecture".
---

## Overview

This skill generates a complete Architecture Design document based on:
- Completed PRD (product requirements)
- Completed IA & User Flow (features and flows)

The AI acts as **Solutions Architect**, recommending technical solutions based on product requirements. User only needs to answer business questions and confirm the solution meets product intent.

**User does NOT need to**:
- Understand technical details
- Make technology choices
- Review code or configurations

---

## Input Files

All inputs are read from `.vibe-doc/`:

| File | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `.vibe-doc/PRD.md` | ✅ | Completed PRD with platform info |
| `.vibe-doc/library-ia-flow.md` | ✅ | Completed IA & User Flow |

---

## Template File

| Template | Path |
|----------|------|
| Architecture Template | `.agents/skills/shared/assets/architecture/architecture-template.md` |

---

## Output File

| Output | Path |
|--------|------|
| Architecture Design | `.vibe-doc/architecture.md` |

## .vibe-doc Preservation Gate

- Read `.agents/rules/shared/vibe-doc-preservation.md` before creating or updating any `.vibe-doc/*` file.
- Never overwrite a non-empty `.vibe-doc` document with a blank file or raw template.
- If `.vibe-doc/architecture.md` already exists and is non-empty, read it first and update in place.
- Only initialize from template when `.vibe-doc/architecture.md` is missing or empty.

---

## Workflow

### First Run (Initialization)

```
1. READ `.vibe-doc/PRD.md`
   - Extract platform(s) from Section 1.4
   - Extract features and requirements
   - Note answers to business questions
                               │
                               ▼
2. READ `.vibe-doc/library-ia-flow.md`
   - Extract entities and relationships
   - Extract user flows

3. COPY template from `.agents/skills/shared/assets/architecture/architecture-template.md`
   CREATE `.vibe-doc/architecture.md` only if the target file is missing or empty
   If the target file already exists and is non-empty, keep it and continue from the current content
                               │
                               ▼
4. SCAN Business Questions Checklist
   - Mark questions answered by PRD as SKIP

                               ▼
5. ASK remaining business questions
   (Batch short questions, 3-5 per round)
                               │
                               ▼
6. SUMMARIZE all requirements (from PRD + IA + answers)
   Confirm with user before generating
                               │
                               ▼
7. GENERATE architecture based on:

8. SAVE and report progress
```

### Resume (User says "continue" or "继续")

```
1. READ `.vibe-doc/architecture.md`
2. IDENTIFY last completed section
3. CONTINUE from next incomplete section
4. ASK questions if needed
5. SAVE and report progress
```

### Update (User says "modify" or "修改")

```
1. ASK: "Which section do you want to modify?"
2. WAIT for user response
3. NAVIGATE to specified section
4. ASK for changes or re-generate

## Business Questions Checklist

### CRITICAL RULE: Skip Questions Already Answered

Before asking any question, AI MUST check:

```
FOR EACH question in checklist:
  1. Search PRD for answer
     - Check relevant sections
     - Check user stories
     - Check feature list
     - Check AI Implementation Notes
  
  2. Search IA/User Flow for answer
     - Check flow descriptions
     - Check edge cases
     - Check view states
  
  3. IF answer found:
     - Mark as SKIP
     - Note the answer and source
     - DO NOT ask user
  
  4. IF answer NOT found or AMBIGUOUS:
     - Add to questions list
     - ASK user
```

**Example of skipping:**

```
PRD Section 3.1 says: "User registration with email and password"
→ SKIP question U2 (How do users sign up?)
→ Answer is: Email + password (Source: PRD 3.1)

IA Flow F-03 says: "Sign in with Apple flow"  
→ SKIP question U2 about social login
→ Answer includes: Apple Sign In (Source: IA F-03)

PRD Section 2.1 says: "Single user, personal use"
→ SKIP questions D1, D2, D3 about sharing
→ Answer is: Private data, no sharing (Source: PRD 2.1)
```

I've gathered requirements from your PRD, IA documents, and our conversation.

### From Your Documents (PRD & IA)
- Platforms: Web, iOS, macOS
- User accounts: Required, email + password + Apple Sign In
- Data model: Users, Projects, Tasks (from IA entities)
- Key flows: Registration, Login, CRUD operations (from IA)
- [Other extracted requirements]

### From Our Conversation
- Offline: View cached data, queue creates
- Sync: Real-time for active users
- Notifications: Push for reminders, email for transactional
- [Other answered questions]

### Assumptions (using defaults)
- Session: Multi-device allowed, 7-day refresh token
- Storage: 100MB per user (standard tier)
- Analytics: PostHog for product analytics
- [Other reasonable defaults]

**Does this accurately capture your requirements?**

If yes, I'll generate the architecture document.
If anything is wrong or missing, please let me know.

## AI Recommendation Principles

### Default Tech Choices

| Component | Default | Change If |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Backend | Supabase | Need custom logic → add Edge Functions |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Supabase) | Need document store → consider alternatives |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Enterprise SSO → add Auth0 |
| Storage | Supabase Storage | Large files/video → dedicated CDN |
| Web | Next.js 14 | Simple static → plain React |
| iOS/macOS | SwiftUI | Need complex AppKit → hybrid |
| Extension | Plasmo | Single browser → vanilla MV3 |
| Email | Resend | High volume → SendGrid |
| Analytics | PostHog | Enterprise → Amplitude |
| Payments | Stripe + IAP | Crypto → add processor |

### Data Model Generation

From IA/User Flow, extract:
- **Entities**: Nouns in flows (User, Project, Task)
- **Relationships**: Ownership, references (User has Projects)
- **Attributes**: Fields in UI (title, status, due_date)
- **Enums**: Status fields (draft, active, completed)
- **Constraints**: Required fields, unique fields

### API Generation

From User Flows, generate:
- **Auth endpoints**: From auth flows
- **CRUD endpoints**: For each entity
- **Validation**: From form fields in UI
- **Errors**: From edge cases in flows
- **Permissions**: From data ownership model
